Distributed Edge-AI Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation using CARLA & Jetson Nano
Overview

This project implements a Distributed Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation framework for autonomous driving using CARLA and Jetson Nano.

The system separates simulation and edge computation:

A Windows PC runs the CARLA simulator.

A Jetson Nano acts as an embedded edge AI device.

Both systems communicate over a network using TCP.

The objective is to simulate a realistic autonomous vehicle architecture where perception and control algorithms run on an edge device while interacting with a high-fidelity simulator in real time.

Objective

This project focuses on:

Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation

Distributed AI systems

Edge computing for autonomous vehicles

Real-time network-based control architectures

The system will be progressively expanded with advanced perception and control algorithms.
